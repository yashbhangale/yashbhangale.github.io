# Getting Started with Next.js 15: A Complete Guide

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building React applications even more powerful and efficient. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore what's new and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

- **Turbopack**: Lightning-fast bundler for development
- **Enhanced App Router**: Improved routing with better performance
- **Server Actions**: Simplified server-side operations
- **Partial Prerendering**: Hybrid static and dynamic rendering

## Installation

Getting started with Next.js 15 is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Key Features

### 1. App Router

The App Router provides a new way to organize your application:

```javascript
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15</h1>
      <p>Building the future of web development</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Server Components

Server Components allow you to render components on the server:

```javascript
// This component runs on the server
async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 3. Styling with Tailwind CSS

Next.js 15 works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS:

```html
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
    Beautiful Design
  </h1>
  <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
    Create stunning interfaces with utility-first CSS.
  </p>
</div>
```

## Performance Optimizations

Next.js 15 includes several performance improvements:

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Pages are automatically split for faster loading
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in image optimization with the `next/image` component
- **Bundle Analysis**: Built-in tools to analyze your bundle size

## Deployment

Deploying your Next.js 15 application is simple with Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with zero configuration

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for Next.js 15 development:

- Use Server Components for data fetching
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize images and fonts
- Use TypeScript for better developer experience
- Follow the principle of least privilege for API routes

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a significant leap forward in React development. With its improved performance, developer experience, and powerful features, it's an excellent choice for building modern web applications.
